## Conway's Game of Life Development Techniques Project

Conway's Game of Life  written in C using SDL2 for graphic rendering.This project runs both in console and with the help of SDL2.
## Installation
        Libraries for installation before running project:
        sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install libcunit1 libcunit1-doc libcunit1-dev libsdl2-2.0 gcovr cmake  doxygen

## Branches and Tags

6 versions of project exists:
Tags: Branches

- v1.0 : step1 - to develop a first version of a code to visualize the Game of Life in console with ansi.
- v2.0 : step2 - Split development and implement CMake instead of make
- v3.0 : step3 - New version of game developed. Now Game can be played clipped and circular modes.
- v4.0 : step4 - Implementing SDL2 library for graphical rendering.
- v5.0 : step5 - Adding Unit tests for project with help of CUnit library.
- NaN : master- Continuous integration added and step5 branch merged to master.

### Standard rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under- population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies,as if by over-population.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Options

When running program:

- Do you want to display in Console => 1 or SDL2 => 2?
  1 for running in Console
  2 for running in SDL2
- Clipped=1 or Circular=2
  1 for Clipped version
  2 for Circlar version
